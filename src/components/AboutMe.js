              <p>I like finger painting and drawing cartoon sketches. I learned from just randomly drawing my own face and youtube tutorial. Most recently I found this lady named Taco Taratino. She tells storytimes(not kid friendly) as well as shows herself painting colors from time to time. </p>
        
              <h2>BJJ</h2>

              <p>A recent hobby is Brazilian Jui Jitsu. I'm still a beginner. But my coach has been teaching me a lot of ground work. Where the big guys get on you and you have to fight out by any means neccessary. Well shrimp out cause there is no hitting in BJJ.</p></>
